# flask-microservice
Python based Flask microservice application

######	Project Structure  ######


1. README.md
The README.md should give a clear picture of your project and its structure. Here’s a sample outline:

Project Overview:

"This project demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, and Python. It automates the deployment of a Flask-based microservices application, deploying it to an EKS cluster on AWS."

Technologies Used:
AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes (EKS), Python, Flask, GitHub.

Project Features:
Infrastructure as Code with Terraform to set up AWS resources.
CI/CD Pipeline with AWS CodePipeline, triggered on code updates.
Automated Testing and Building in CodeBuild with Docker containerization.
Continuous Deployment on EKS.
Optional Monitoring with AWS CloudWatch or Prometheus (if added).
Setup and Deployment Instructions:

Step-by-step guide for:
Cloning the Repository: git clone [repo-url]
Configuring AWS: Setting up credentials.
Provisioning Infrastructure: Running Terraform commands to set up the VPC, EKS, IAM roles, and ECR.
Running the Pipeline: Pushing changes to GitHub to trigger the pipeline.
Accessing the Application: Instructions on how to access the deployed application in EKS (e.g., via LoadBalancer or Ingress URL).
Pipeline Workflow:

CodePipeline: Describe the stages (Source, Build, Deploy) and what each stage accomplishes.
CodeBuild: Explain how CodeBuild builds the Docker image, runs tests, and pushes it to ECR.
2. Project Files and Folder Structure
Organize the following files for easy navigation:

Application Code
app/app.py: Main Flask application file with some simple routes.
app/requirements.txt: Dependencies for the Flask app (e.g., Flask, pytest).
tests/: Include a tests/ folder with unit tests for your application.
Docker Configuration
Dockerfile: Instructions for containerizing the Flask app, typically placed in the app folder.
Kubernetes Manifests
Folder: kubernetes/
Files:
deployment.yaml: Defines the Kubernetes Deployment for the Flask app.
service.yaml: Exposes the application to a network, either through LoadBalancer or NodePort.
Terraform Files
Folder: terraform/
Files:
main.tf: Primary Terraform configuration file for provisioning AWS resources.
variables.tf: Defines variables for reusability (e.g., AWS region, instance types).
outputs.tf: Output information, such as EKS cluster endpoint.
provider.tf: AWS provider configuration.
AWS CodeBuild Configuration
buildspec.yml: Define build commands and test phases, typically placed in the project root.
